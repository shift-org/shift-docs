# Calendar API

**Work in progress**

----

## General

Base URL:
* production: `https://www.shift2bikes.org/api/`
* local development: `https://localhost:4443/api/`

Most responses are in JSON format, except for:
* event export returns vCalendar format
* event crawl returns HTML

## Viewing events

### Retrieving public event data

Endpoint:
* GET `events`

Example requests:
* `/events.php?startdate=2019-06-01&enddate=2019-06-15`
* `/events.php?id=1234`

URL parameters:
* `startdate`:
  * first day of range, inclusive
  * `YYYY-MM-DD` format
  * if not provided, current date is used
* `enddate`:
  * last day of range, inclusive
  * `YYYY-MM-DD` format
  * if not provided, current date is used
* `id`:
  * `caldaily` event ID
  * if `id` is provided, it takes precedence over `startdate` and `enddate`; the date range will be ignored

Unknown parameters are ignored.

It is recommended that you always provide either an event `id` or both `startdate` and `enddate`. Relying on default or inferred values may return unexpected results.

Success:
* status code: `200`
* `events`: array of event objects; array may be empty
* each event object: key-value pairs of all available public fields; does not contain any private fields (use `manage_event` endpoint for those)
* when using `id` parameter, array is expected to return 1 object; if the ID does not match a known event, you will receive a `200` response with an empty `events` array

Example response for a single event:

      "events": [

Come on this ride and we will talk a little bit about the history of shift and try to find you a place to help out in the future.  We will end at a family friendly watering hole.

        {
          "id": "1234",
          ...

      }
    }

Errors:
* status code: `400`
* `error`: object containing `message` key
* `message`: text string explaining the error
* possible errors
  * `enddate` before `startdate`
  * date range too large (100 days maximum)

Example error:

    {
      "error": {
        "message": "enddate: 2019-06-01 is before startdate: 2019-06-15"
      }
    }

## Managing events

### Retrieving all event data

Endpoint:
* GET `retrieve_event`

URL parameters:
* `id`: `calevent` event ID
* `secret`: event password

The `retrieve_event` endpoint returns all private data for the event (if the `secret` is provided) so it can be edited. If you just want to retrieve public data to display the event, use the `event` endpoint.

Success:
* status code: `200`
* key-value pairs of all available fields; the response is similar to the `event` endpoint's event object, but note that they are not identical (the `datestatuses` block, for example)
* if a valid `secret` is provided, all stored values are returned; if not, you still get a `200` response but private fields (e.g. `email`) will be empty

Example response:
