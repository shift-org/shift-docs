# How to start up a new server instance for shift-docs


This is a step-by-step guide to build a brand new server.  Portland's shift org uses it to run api.shift2bikes.org but it also hosts all the static content in case you want a one-server setup and don't want to use Netlify for the front end.

## Specific setup steps for server at AWS

Starting from the from AWS console homepage once you login,

- go to [`EC2` product area](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#Home)
- go to [`Instances` subsection](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:instanceState=running), which will show a list of running instances by default.  Within that page, select the current production server and note some of its details:
	- We find a `t3.micro` to be more than sufficient for building and hosting the site even during our higher traffic times
		- Portland-specific: `t3.micro` will be a cost savings due to our reserved instance config pre-committing to the server for a year (renewal: each April)
	- for subnet (you'll need to make sure new machine is in same subnet ID)
	- for VPC (same,  except VPC ID)
	- for security group name (under security) - launch-wizard-1
	- for storage size - note: 2 volumes - default 30G+secondary 30G EBS

With those details in hand, head to [Launch instance](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-west-2#LaunchInstances)

- *make sure you're in region Oregon `us-west-2`* (upper right dropdown)
- choose ubuntu quickstart - will give LTS latest AMI (24.04 as of this writing)
- set a name - latest is `production 2025`)
- ensure instance type, security group, subnet, VPC matches existinge match prod
- setup a key pair and make note of private key, you'll need it soon!
- configure storage (update default to 30GB, add second 30GB)
- no need to change any `Advanced Details` except enabling termination protection (nice to have; not required)
- finally, click `launch instance` 

Then:

- you can see it running under `Instances`
- from your own laptop, you should be able to `ssh -i newkeypair.id ubuntu@new-IP` after saving the keypair to a safe directory (`~/.ssh`) with safe permissions (`600`)
- ...and copy auth in via the new login to `newserver:~/.ssh/authorized_keys` from `oldserver:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`,  to grant the rest of the team access

## Specific setup steps on the server to get it ready to run our stack.

All commands below are executed as `ubuntu` user which is the default login we share.  We'll put `sudo` in front of the ones that need to run as root - but you're logged in as ubuntu!

Start by mapping the second volume we created during instance creation into /opt/shift-docs:

	`lsblk` will show a line like this with no assigned path:
		nvme1n1      259:0    0   30G  0 disk
		# (compare to the used volume that has a "tree" of mount points underneath it on partitions)
		# we'll assume nvme1n1 from here on out but please make sure that corresponds with your reality!
	sudo fdisk /dev/nvme1n1
	# create a single partition using the whole disk
	sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme1n1p1
	# and add to fstab
		/dev/nvme1n1p1	/opt/shift-docs	 ext4	discard,commit=30,errors=remount-ro	0 1
	

Next, set a (temporary?) hostname that you have setup DNS for:

	sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newserver.shift2bikes.org

Now, create an SSH key that we'll use to pull the public repo...

	ssh-keygen  # set no password, this is only used to clone public repo

...and then configure GitHub to allow this pull for your repo/fork. READ-ONLY perms on GH!

	# visit https://ubuntu.com/pro to set up ESM (Enhanced Security/Maintenance)
	sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade to pull in all latest security fixes
	sudo reboot

	# need this group setup for our hugo container
	sudo groupadd -g 1234 hugo -U ubuntu
	# log out and back in after running the above to get the new group membership

	sudo chown ubuntu:hugo /opt/shift-docs
	cd /opt
	git clone git@github.com:shift-org/shift-docs.git
	# prepping permissions for hugo container
	mkdir -p /opt/shift-docs/site/public
	touch /opt/shift-docs/site/.hugo_build.lock
	# you'll get permissions errors on this next line unless you've logged out+back in!
	chgrp hugo /opt/shift-docs/site/public /opt/shift-docs/site/.hugo_build.lock
	chmod g+w /opt/shift-docs/site/public /opt/shift-docs/site/.hugo_build.lock



(cf steps in https://github.com/shift-org/shift-docs/blob/main/docs/new-server-config-details.txt)

	# add 1.5G swap file since 1G memory is not enough:  
	sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/.swap bs=1M count=1500
	sudo chmod 600 /.swap
	# add this to /etc/fstab: /.swap                   swap            swap defaults 0 0
	sudo mkswap /.swap
	swapon -a


## Now, setup docker from docker, ignoring ubuntu's version!

### First, getting the prerequisites ready

	sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
	sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
	sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
	sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

### Add the repository to Apt sources:

	echo \
	  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
	  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
	  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

### Verify that the installation is successful by running the hello-world image:
	sudo docker run hello-world
	# this should get docker usable by the ubuntu user
	sudo adduser ubuntu docker
	# you'll need to log out and back in after doing this!!

### running the site!

- need to add the overrides file as default: `cd /opt/shift-docs ; ln -s shift.overrides.production shift.overrides`
- now you can run the site, but can't visit it yet; you should be able to set up SSL now though:

		sudo apt-get install certbot
		# if you aren't doing this with the prod hostname, you'll need to change the certbot.sh script to have the temporary hostname
		# no matter what, you need to add --agree-tos and --email bikecal@shift2bikes.org to line 23 of certbot script 
		# please don't use our email address if you aren't us :)
		# TODO update the master copy in the repo once this is new prod
		# run certbot script
		cd /opt/shift-docs ; sudo ./services/nginx/certbot.sh

- restoring event data:

		# on oldserver:
		`./shift mysqldump > backup.mysql`
		# edit the output to remove the top line and also the line with the error about PROCESS
		# on new server, copy file over
		`cat backup.mysql | ./shift mysql-pipe`

- restoring image data:

		# on oldserver:
		`cd /opt/shift-docs/backend/eventimages ; tar czf ~/images.tgz .`
		# on new server, copy file over, and then...
		`sudo chown ubuntu:hugo /opt/shift-docs/backend/eventimages`
		`cd /opt/shift-docs/backend/eventimages ; tar xzf ~/images.tgz`

- then you should be able to visit the new site directly!

### wrap up details

We have a backup script that uses the AWS CLI, so:
		snap install aws-cli --classic
...and we use a few tools we'd like to be there:
		apt-get install vim tmux
Don't forget to add the cron job for certbot!

We also set up snapshots in AWS for the server
