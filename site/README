# Understanding the site

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the ([Universal](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme) theme. All of the edits related to the theme and its content are done in **shift-docs/site**. see docs/THEME_EDITING.md for more info.

# Folder structure

**Important: changes can't be done in the Public directory.**

`site/`

`|── archetypes/` Archetypes generate new pages when running "hugo new content" at the command line. The site/archetypes take precedence over the theme archetypes. See: https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/

`|── content/` The pages for the site. `.md` files in these directories get transformed into `.html` (etc.) when Hugo is built.

Each page contains two parts: "head matter" and "content". Among other things, the head matter selects a layout file ( using `type: <name of layout>` ), and specifies variables for use when the page is built ( via `{{ .Params }}` ). If the head matter starts and end with triple dashes, the format of the data is in yaml; triple pluses indicate toml format.

Each sub-directory can contain an `_index.md` which provides data for rendering the list of file in that directory. ( Or an `index.md` which can substitute a single page in place of a directory listing. )

`    └── archive` This is where we keep pages that are older and unlikely to be updated.

`    └── playbooks`  This is documentation, somewhat like shift-docs/docs, but the accessible via the website.

`    └── pages`  This is where the majority of the page content from the site are located. Some examples of such pages ( which are linked to in the site menu ):

`        └── pages/get-involved.md` becomes https://www.shift2bikes.org/pages/get-involved/
`        └── pages/pedalpalooza.md` becomes https://www.shift2bikes.org/pages/pedalpalooza/


`|── data/` Provides global data for use during build. Each data directory becomes a dictionary within `{{ .Site.Data }}`. For example, the carousel data is available via `{{ .Site.Data.carousel }}` https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/#the-data-directory

`    └── clients` Used for the "Sponsors" section on the home page.

`    └── carousel`
 This is where the text/settings are defined for the carousel on the home page. There are four properties needed for each slide:

> - Weight: this number represents the order of the slide.
> - Title: this is the text displayed on the slide when we are viewing the page in the browser.
> - Description: TO BE VERIFIED
> - Image: a path to the image used

`|── layouts/`
Layouts (also called templates) do the actual conversion of the content into output. The site/layouts take precedence over the theme/layouts. ( **TODO?** Shift's layouts should probably be moved into this directory. )

`   └── layouts/_default` There are three key files:

`      └── baseof.html` Defines a standard structure for every generated file. ( shift currently doesnt use this )

`      └── single.html` Used as a fallback when no specific `type:` has been set for a given content file. This template is used to render all of Shift's "static" pages ( about, faq, playbooks, etc. )

`      └── list.html` Used as a fallback for rendering directory listings when no specific `type:` has been set in the directory's `_index.md`.

`|── public/`  Hugo's output: the site rendered in the browser. *No edits should be done here.*  Not submitted to git.

`|── static/` Contain site assets. Its sub-directories are copied "as is" to public during build. The `admin` sub-directory provides information to netlify so that the static pages of the shift site can be edited via the netlify cms.

`|── themes/s2b_hugo_theme`  Default layouts, css styles, etc. based on https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme. **TODO** Some niceties would be to move all shift changes into the sites folders ( sites overrides themes ), and to pull in the theme as a "module" https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/.

`   └── archetypes/` The theme's archetype(s), ignored because overridden by site/archetypes.

`   └── i18n/` Translations into other languages for common bits of text. ( comes with theme; the shift site isn't translated. )

`   └── layouts/` Contains shift's html templates.

`   └── static/` Contains a mix of shift's static files and the theme's static files ( css styles, javascript, and images. ) style.default.css is used by this project and minor changes were added to another CSS filed named custom.css (themes/s2b_hugo_theme/static/css)

`   └── static/js/libs` Third party javascript used by the site. **TODO?** Might be neat to use hugo's [js.Build](https://gohugo.io/functions/js/build/) so we could use npm ( and a package.json ) to manage these libraries.
