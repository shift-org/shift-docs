## History

 The tradition of a summer bike fun festival in Portland started in Summer of 2002, when the nomadic [BikeSummer festival](http://criticalmass.wikia.com/wiki/Bike_Summer!) came to Portland.  We had so much fun that we decided we should keep having bike fun festivals and went through a couple of iterations - including [Mini Bike Summer](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2003/) in 2003 before Pedalpalooza was dreamed up in 2004. It's happened every year since then, and grown quite a bit!
