## Ride riding guidelines

<img src="/images/ride_riding_comic.png" alt="Ride riding comic, described below" height=800>


### Know your ride.

Every ride is different. Some are casual, slow, meanderings. Some are hammer-it-out sufferfests. Check the online Pedalpalooza calendar for more detailed info.


### Expect the unexpected.

Just because you think you know what the ride is about, doesn't mean that you know what the ride is about. Don't stress out. Chill out, go with the flow. You might enjoy yourself! 


### Safety in numbers does not mean let your guard down.

Just because you're in a big group doesn't mean that traffic laws — or the laws of physics — don't apply. Be aware of your surroundings and your fellow riders. 


### Be prepared!

A Pedalpalooza readiness kit should include:
* flyers for your event
* snacks
* condoms
* TriMet fare
* tool kit
* bike map
* Pedalpalooza calendar
