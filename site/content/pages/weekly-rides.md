Any day of the week is a good day for bike fun! Many groups have regularly-scheduled rides that happen on a specific day of the week. Some of these happen every week, or every other; all of the ones listed here happen at least once a month.

This is just a sample — there are also plenty of one-off or less-frequent rides beyond these. Check the [calendar](https://www.shift2bikes.org/calendar/) for the latest. If you host a regularly-scheduled ride and would like to see it listed here, please [contact us](https://www.shift2bikes.org/pages/contact/).

### Bike Happy Hour
* Every Wednesday
* Starting location: Gorges Beer Co., SE Ankeny St between 27th & 28th Ave (aka Ankeny Rainbow Road)

Not a ride itself, but a great place to hang out with other bike-y folks. Come by 3pm to 6pm (-ish) and enjoy community, food, and drinks. The only rules are to be nice and to keep your socializing circles open to new people! Name tags are encouraged as well; see Jonathan Maus or another Happy Hour Ambassador if you need one. Rides sometimes use this happy hour as a starting location, so check the calendar each Wednesday for related bike fun!
