## Around the world

The [World Naked Bike Ride](http://worldnakedbikeride.org/) (WNBR) is a global movement that rides as a protest to bring a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world. It's a free, non-sexual, fun bike ride! There are hundreds of events every year under the WNBR banner â€” some with only a handful of participants, and some with thousands! 

If you find yourself wondering why thousands of people choose to ride in the buff, read more about it on the [World Naked Bike Ride Wiki](http://wiki.worldnakedbikeride.org/index.php?title=About) and [PDX WNBR's explainer](https://pdxwnbr.org/why/). 


## The Portland World Naked Bike Ride

The [Portland World Naked Bike Ride](https://pdxwnbr.org) (PDX WNBR) is our local WNBR event since 2004. 

In any given year, PDX WNBR is usually the largest organized point-to-point bike ride in the state! It has a well-planned route, infrastructure like portapotties and security staff, and around 10,000 participants.
