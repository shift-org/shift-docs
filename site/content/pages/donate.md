## Donate time

Want to help make bike fun happen? Shift is an all-volunteer organization and we can use your help! Check out ways to [Get Involved](/pages/get-involved/) and come join us. Have an idea that isn't listed there? [Contact us](/pages/contact/) and let's talk!


## Donate money

Donations to Shift are tax-deductible via our fiscal sponsor, [Umbrella](https://www.umbrellapdx.org/). You can see how we use this money on our [expenses](/pages/budget-finance-stuff/) page.

Donate to Shift using Zeffy with the Donate button below. When possible we prefer Zeffy since they don't take a cut as PayPal does!

<div class="donate">
  <a href="{{% param "donations.primaryURL" %}}" target="_blank">Donate with Zeffy</a>
</div>

We also accept donations via PayPal:

<div class="donate">
  <a href="{{% param "donations.secondaryURL" %}}" target="_blank">Donate with PayPal</a>
</div>

Donations can also be made by mailing a check to Umbrella:

Shift c/o Umbrella<br>
PO Box 14442<br>
Portland, OR  97293

If you'd like to donate by another method, [contact us](/pages/contact/).
