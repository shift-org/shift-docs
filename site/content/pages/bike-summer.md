## History

The tradition of a summer bike fun festival in Portland started in summer of 2002, when the nomadic [Bike Summer festival](https://criticalmass.wikia.com/wiki/Bike_Summer!) came to Portland. We had so much fun that we decided we should keep having bike fun festivals and went through a couple of iterations — including [Mini Bike Summer](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2003/) in 2003 before Pedalpalooza was dreamed up in 2004. It's happened every year since then, and grown quite a bit! It grew from 2 weeks, to 3, to a whole month! After a semi-hiatus in 2020, in 2021 it adopted a three month long format. In 2022 we embraced our roots and went back to the original Bike Summer name.
