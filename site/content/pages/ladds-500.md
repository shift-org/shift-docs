## About

> It's not a race, it's a relay

The Ladd's 500 is a free, one day, bicycle-themed public picnic and non-competitive bicycle relay event where teams complete 500 [laps around Ladd Circle](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/12292312).

500 laps of [Ladd Circle](https://www.portland.gov/parks/ladd-circle-park-and-rose-gardens) is a century (100 miles). Form teams of at least one person, switch riders or bikes at least 10 times during your laps, and turn left for a while. If you're not riding, party in the middle.
