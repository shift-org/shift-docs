On the last Friday of every month, volunteers serve breakfast to bicyclists on the Steel, Flanders, Blumenauer, and Tillikum bridges. Many bike commuters have come to look forward to hot coffee and delicious pastries on their way to work once a month - and you can't beat the views! Note: they generally arrive on the bridges around 7:00 a.m. and stay till 9:00. 

Join them for this fun, community-building event. Stop by on your way to work, school, shopping, or wherever you and your bike are going.

## Schedule

Breakfast on the Bridges happens **7:00 - 9:00 am on the last Friday of every month**. Well... pretty much. At the end of the year, both BonB's land near major holidays, so the Thanksgiving and Christmas BonB events are combined and placed near St. Lucia's day, Dec 13th.

They occasionally host pop-up events on other days, so check the [calendar](/calendar/) for the latest!

## Locations

### Current Locations

There are four regular serving locations as of 2023:

1. **Steel Bridge**: Team Steel sets up just East of the entrance to the lower bike/ped path (north end of the Eastbank Esplanade). Great views of the river and downtown skyline. 
2. **Tillikum Bridge**:  Team Tillikum sets up on the West side of the bridge, under the Red Balloons statue at the junction of S Bond Ave Multi-Use Path and the Bridge.
3. **Blumenauer Bridge**: Team Blumenauer stations on the North end of the bridge. Now that the Hawthorne Bridge crew has relocated to the Blumenauer Bridge, all 4 BonB locations are car-free!
4. **Flanders Crossing**: Expanding to four bridges for the first time! Say hi-diddly-ho to your bikey neighbors on one of the city's newest car-free bridges. 

### Past Locations

1. **Morrison Bridge**: Breakfast was served on the Morrison for a year or two around 2013â€“2014.  Thanks to Lance and Paul!
2. **Broadway Bridge**: Is where the tradition started over a decade ago.  Thanks Carl, Ayleen, and Timo!
3. **Hawthorne Bridge**: The Hawthorne crew stationed the west end of the bridge for many years, but moved to the Blumenauer Bridge late 2022. Stop by and say hi at their new location!

## Volunteers

BonB is brought to you by a team of bike-fun-loving morning people (and those of us who drink enough coffee to resemble morning people). It takes many hands and much energy to deliver breakfast to so many cyclists in the morning and they love to share the work load opportunity to spread joy. There's much brewing, baking, and donation retrieval to be done, but if you're not the type who plans ahead just show up and put your friendly smile to use - they always enjoy company on the bridges! If you're interested in helping out, [get in touch with BonB volunteers](mailto:bonb@lists.riseup.net).

BonB is planned and organized through the occasional meeting and plenty of electronic correspondence through the [BonB mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/bonb). Maybe handing out breakfast before the sun comes up isn't your thing? They're always looking for friendly and creative folks to help find donors, pick up and drop off donations, and promote BonB via creative signs and feeding logistics.

## Donors

Free breakfast doesn't grow on trees! Unless it's fruit... BonB is happy to have the support of several local coffee and pastry shops as well as other food donors. And they're always looking for more! If you'd like to contribute to Breakfast on the Bridges, please [contact them](mailto:bonb@lists.riseup.net)!

## Other

Tardy slips are often available for those who are running late. They may not get you out of trouble, but they'll probably lighten the mood. At least you won't be trying to explain yourself on an empty stomach. 

BonB Superhero trading cards (on hand at special times) are a popular collectible commodity. You can expect them to triple in value over the next ten years. A whole set may someday go for eight times its original value at auction.
