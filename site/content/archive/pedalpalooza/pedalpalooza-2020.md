<strong class="pp-headline">Pedalpalooza is going to be different this year!</strong>

[Pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza/) 2020 is about individuals finding ways to celebrate the joy of cycling. We will not be encouraging people to gather, as we have in previous years. Read more on our [public health](/pages/public-health/) page.

**But wait!** You can still have #bikefun — separately, but together! Check out the solo ride themes below, and see [Pedalpalooza.org](https://www.pedalpalooza.org/ride) for more info.
