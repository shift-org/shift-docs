  </dt><dd>Vancouver, Marshall Center, 1009 E. McLoughlin Blvd.
  <br>6:00pm every Tuesday
  <br>Join in for this very popular series.
	The route heads through downtown Vancouver on Evergreen
	and then onto the Mill Plain extension to Lower River Road.
	There are two options -
	The shorter route goes to Frenchman's Bar Park and is a
	more social pace.
	The longer option goes to the end of the road and is a
	faster pace.
	This is mostly a flat route, excellent for those advancing
	from beginner to intermediate riding.
	Flat, 14mph, Re-Group, 17-26 miles.

  </dt><dd>Wallace Park, NW 25th &amp; Raleigh, by Chapman School
  <br>6:15pm
  <br>Portland may seem like a pizza wasteland, but never fear, there are
	bastions of thin, run-down-your-chin pies to be found. We'll eat and
	ride as long as we're able, calling ahead to order cheese pizzas cut
	into squares (as they were meant to be) so that everyone can eat as
	much or as little as they like.
	<p>
	This tour is heavily biased toward the thin-crusted  East Coast
	tradition, New Haven style in particular. California gourmands and
	die-hard Chicagoans are welcome but requested to keep heckling to a
	minimum.
	</p><p>
	Bring cash for pizza (cost will depend on number of riders, but will
	probably be a dollar or two per person per pizza place). RSVP if you
	can to:
