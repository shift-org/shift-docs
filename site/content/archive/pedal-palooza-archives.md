[comment]: <> (aka, That Fun Thing We Do Every June)

In 2002, Portland hosted [Bike Summer](http://criticalmass.wikia.com/wiki/Bike_Summer!), and it was great! So, every summer since then, we've had another festival which is now called <dfn>Pedalpalooza</dfn>. Choose one of the following years to see its calendar of events.

*   [2018](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2018/)

    Another month of bike fun — all of June! 309 events!


*   [2017](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2017/)

    A whole month of bike fun, June 1 - June 30th. 327 events!

*   [2016](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2016/)

    292 events!

*   [2015](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2015/)

    294 events!

*   [2014](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2014/)

    298 events! 308 if you count repeats.

*   [2013](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2013/)

    280 events, 3+ weeks of bike fun, from June 6th through 29th. The big naked ride Saturday, June 8th, was almost certainly the largest every, anywhere.

*   [2012](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2012/)

    For the first time, we expanded to 3+ weeks of bike fun! The intent was to spread out roughly the same number of events over more days, so you could participate in more of them. 298 events... or 313 if you count each instance of repeating events.

*   [2011](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2011/)

    About 270 events — slightly less than 2010\. The big naked ride was also slightly down, due to weather fears. Be brave! Be ambitious! Try harder in 2012!

*   [2010](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2010/)

    We had roughly 300 events, and a very strong attendance. The naked ride alone had somewhere between 7000 and 12,500 riders.

*   [2009](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2009/)

    In 2009 the number of events was down a tiny bit, but the number of people at each event seemed to double. One highlight is that we had about 5000 people for the World Naked Bike Ride... or nearly 1% of Portlanders!

*   [2008](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2008/)

    Vastly larger than previous years. The Portland Mercury increased their involvement. Shift hosted the International Toward Carfree Cities Conference. The City of Portland had its first Sunday Parkways (Ciclovia). Soaring fuel pricess increased interest in bikes. The result: 185 events in the printed calendar, and 197 events in the online calendar (not counting repeating events). Larger crowds all around. Wonderful. I'm still sleepy.

*   [2007](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2007/)

    The printed calendar had 130 events, and the online calendar ended up with 140\. That's may sound a hair's breadth smaller than PP2006, but actually most of the events attracted far more people in 2007\. Yea Bikes! Go Team! Rah! Rah!

*   [2006](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2006/)

    The printed calendar had 133 events, and the online calendar ended up with 143 (taking cancellations into account). Which was your favorite?

*   [2005](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2005/)

    That Pedalpalooza was huge. The printed calendar had 95 events, but the online calendar, which could be updated throughout the festival, ended up with 114 events.

*   [2004](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2004/)

    The first year that it was called "Pedalpalooza" and the first with a 16-day Thursday-to-Saturday schedule. It had 68 events.

*   [2003](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2003/)

    Mini BikeSummer. 49 events. Apparently, Portland was the first (and so far only?) BikeSummer site to continue the festival on following years. This first year, it was organized in cooperation with [Zoobomb](https://www.zoobombpdx.org/). (A brief [history of Shift and Zoobomb](/archive/shift-and-zoobomb-history/).)

*   [2002](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2002/)

    BikeSummer! In August, not June? Wow, the things we forget. 97 events.
