[comment]: <> (aka, That Fun Thing We Do Every Summer)

In 2002, Portland hosted [Bike Summer](https://criticalmass.wikia.com/wiki/Bike_Summer!), and it was great! So every summer since then, we've had a summer bike festival. From 2004 it was called <dfn>Pedalpalooza</dfn>, and in 2022 it returned to its roots with the original name Bike Summer. Choose one of the following years to see its calendar of events.

*   [Bike Summer 2025](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2025/)

    Just over 1000 events!! Big rides, small rides, and everything in between! Something for everyone, spread all across Portland and beyond.

*   [Bike Summer 2024](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2024/)

    Started on a Saturday and ended Labor Day weekend, with oodles of rides large and small, every day! 875 events!

*   [Bike Summer 2023](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2023/)

    Bike Summer was once again big, bold, and full of bike fun! 836 events!

*   [Bike Summer 2022](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2022/)

    Bike Summer 20th anniversary! We biked and biked and biked all of June, July, and August! Even bigger than last year — 800 events!!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2021](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2021/)

    Back and bigger than ever — 3 whole months! Bike summer lasted all of June, July, and August. Over 600 events!!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2020](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2020/)

    Something different this year — we rode separate, but together. 5 weeks long, with a different theme every day!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2019](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2019/)

    Started on a Saturday, lasted all month! 342 events!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2018](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2018/)

    Another month of bike fun — all of June! 309 events!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2017](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2017/)

    A whole month of bike fun, June 1 - June 30th. 327 events!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2016](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2016/)

    292 events!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2015](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2015/)

    294 events!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2014](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2014/)

    298 events! 308 if you count repeats.

*   [Pedalpalooza 2013](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2013/)

    280 events, 3+ weeks of bike fun, from June 6th through 29th. The big naked ride Saturday, June 8th, was almost certainly the largest ever, anywhere.

*   [Pedalpalooza 2012](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2012/)

    For the first time, we expanded to 3+ weeks of bike fun! The intent was to spread out roughly the same number of events over more days, so you could participate in more of them. 298 events... or 313 if you count each instance of repeating events.

*   [Pedalpalooza 2011](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2011/)

    About 270 events — slightly less than 2010\. The big naked ride was also slightly down, due to weather fears. Be brave! Be ambitious! Try harder in 2012!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2010](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2010/)

    We had roughly 300 events, and a very strong attendance. The naked ride alone had somewhere between 7000 and 12,500 riders.

*   [Pedalpalooza 2009](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2009/)

    In 2009 the number of events was down a tiny bit, but the number of people at each event seemed to double. One highlight is that we had about 5000 people for the World Naked Bike Ride... or nearly 1% of Portlanders!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2008](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2008/)

    Vastly larger than previous years. The Portland Mercury increased their involvement. Shift hosted the International Toward Carfree Cities Conference. The City of Portland had its first Sunday Parkways (Ciclovia). Soaring fuel pricess increased interest in bikes. The result: 185 events in the printed calendar, and 197 events in the online calendar (not counting repeating events). Larger crowds all around. Wonderful. I'm still sleepy.

*   [Pedalpalooza 2007](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2007/)

    The printed calendar had 130 events, and the online calendar ended up with 140\. That's may sound a hair's breadth smaller than PP2006, but actually most of the events attracted far more people in 2007\. Yea Bikes! Go Team! Rah! Rah!

*   [Pedalpalooza 2006](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2006/)

    The printed calendar had 133 events, and the online calendar ended up with 143 (taking cancellations into account). Which was your favorite?

*   [Pedalpalooza 2005](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2005/)

    That Pedalpalooza was huge. The printed calendar had 95 events, but the online calendar, which could be updated throughout the festival, ended up with 114 events.

*   [Pedalpalooza 2004](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2004/)

    The first year that it was called "Pedalpalooza" and the first with a 16-day Thursday-to-Saturday schedule. It had 68 events.

*   [Mini Bike Summer 2003](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2003/)

    Mini BikeSummer. 49 events. Apparently, Portland was the first (and so far only?) BikeSummer site to continue the festival on following years. This first year, it was organized in cooperation with [Zoobomb](https://www.zoobombpdx.org/). (A brief [history of Shift and Zoobomb](/archive/shift-and-zoobomb-history/).)

*   [Bike Summer 2002](/archive/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2002/)

    BikeSummer! In August, not June? Wow, the things we forget. 97 events.
