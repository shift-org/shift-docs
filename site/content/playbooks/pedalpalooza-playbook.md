## overview

Pedalpalooza has a lot of moving parts that hopefully take place starting in January or so.

## artwork and calendar

We used this spreadsheet in 2015 to organize all the required activities.  Thanks Carl Larson!

Here's a write up of how and why and to what goal we edit the calendar:

## Modifications in recent years are:

### artwork

- failure to get things in order in time for artist selection by committee, so picked contributors to the community
- not printing a full run of posters anymore.  It cost money there was negligible community engagement in getting them posted around town.  Now we print a handful and give them out to the artist and key volunteers and high-dollar donors.

### calendar editing doc

...was written up last year but was for the old "classic" calendar so the advice is not universally applicable around the tech - but is applicable around the database and the "what is our goal in editing?" portions.
