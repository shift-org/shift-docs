This project is under active development!  This has some informations, and links to the rest!

This document is incomplete;  check out [more current information in the README on Github](https://github.com/shift-org/shift-docs#overview) and also extensive docs in the [docs directory of that project](https://github.com/shift-org/shift-docs/tree/master/docs)

Shift uses [Amazon's AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host our website.  Chris/fool is currently paying for AWS but will submit expenses to Shift for payment.

Shift's Domains are registered through [Dotster](https://www.dotster.com) and are hooked to fool's credit card:

- shift2bikes.org
- shift2bikes.com
- shifttobikes.org
- shifttobikes.com


pedalpalooza.org needs to be transferred from its current registrar soon;  Brian Scrivner still controls that.

Several people can potentially help with website or calendar problems, including chris (@fool), Vincent (@sdobz), and Josh (@carrythebanner)

The calendar is written in php, talks to a mysql database that is backed up semi-regularly.


The [website](https://www.shift2bikes.org) and [calendar](https://shift2bikes.org/calendar/) are their own codebase in [GitHub](https://github.com), which is free to join, use in any way that you might while collaborating with us on mainteance/development, and of course free to download from.

Some of the old website/calendar codebase is in github here: https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shiftcal/tree/Legacy

We generally meet once a week to work on the website/calendar.  Ping the [website crew](mailto:bikecal@shift2bikes.org) to get details about our next meetup.  All are welcome;  coders, testers, content editors, visionaries, etc.
