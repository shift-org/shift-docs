Shift has a facebook page, so does pedalpalooza.  pedalpalooza has a twitter account.

Only the pedalpalooza FB and twitter accounts are particularly active, but we are recruiting to get some instagram coverage and other.  These accounts are generally run by a few people together so "one person" doesn't have to do all the work and folks gently "police" one another.

This is a super informal agreement, and is not intended to be exclusionary or exclusive, though the teams often "work together" to plan "at least one post per day for pedalpalooza" or similar.
