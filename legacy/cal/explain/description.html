    <h1><center>Event Descriptions</center></h1>
    <p>
    Each event has two descriptions:
    A full one used in the online calendar,
    and a smaller one used in the printed calendar.
    <p>
    The full description is limited to 600 characters.
    You're allowed to use some basic formatting:
    <ul>
      <li> <p>"Hard" line breaks are preserved.
	   The &lt;Enter&gt; key creates hard line breaks.
	   </p><p>
	   "Soft" breaks, where a long line automatically wraps around to
	   the start of the next line, will still vary with the width of the
	   user's browser window and the size of their font.  You can see this
	   effect in the preview pane by resizing the form's window.</p>
      <li> <p>Multiple spaces will be preserved so you can indent lines if
	   you wish.</p>
      <li> <p>Words surrounded by asterisks will be displayed in boldface, and
	   the asterisks themselves will be hidden.
	   For example, "*Helmets Required*" will be displayed as
	   "<strong>Helmets Required</strong>".
	   Asterisks in other contexts
	   (for example, as a bullet at the start of a line)
	   will remain asterisks.</p>
      <li> Text that looks like a URL will be treated as a link.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The print description is limited to 120 characters, and it doesn't allow
    any fancy formatting at all.  This is due to the fact that there are only
    a few days between our event submission deadline, and our printer's
    final copy deadline.  During that time, we need to come up with a creative,
    attractive, and compact way to present 150 or so events.  If each event
    was allowed to have an elaborate description, that job would be practically
    impossible.
