# [build] and [build.environment] are defaults; will apply to all builds unless overridden in a context stanza below

[build]

  # note: if you're using the netlify cli ( ie. "netlify dev" ) 
  # this needs to be simply "public" ( otherwise it looks for "site/site/public" )
  # tbd: is the global site config on netlify overriding this?
  # could we switch this to be "public" always?
  publish = "site/public/"

[build.environment]
  # see also package.json, and docker-compose.yml
  HUGO_VERSION = "0.128.2"

# we need to manually copy the 404 page over for now, in every environment
# cf https://github.com/shift-org/shift-docs/issues/862

[context.deploy-preview]
  # this command additionally builds draft content for deploy previews (PR's)
  # you'd set a page as draft in the frontmatter of the markdown.

[context.production]
  # Note that there are two versions of the below command 
  # drafts are excluded (no `-D` option to hugo) for prod build.  
  # We also pull new backend code to the server for prod deploys

  # see this guide about why we do this funky thing with ssh: 
  # https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-using-an-ssh-key-via-environment-variable-during-build/2457

  # TL;DR comment out the next line if you are working on your own Netlify site!

## need to support multiple domains?  
## Use domain redirects to serve alternative domains.  
## First, canonicalize secondarydomain.com to primarydomain.org
## so that we can serve all content via the "best" hostname (NETLIFY DNS record)
## such redirects must be first redirects in this file!

[[redirects]]
  from = "https://secondarydomain.com/*"
  to = "https://www.primarydomain.org/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true
[[redirects]]
  from = "https://www.secondarydomain.com/*"
  to = "https://www.primarydomain.org/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## dynamic back end + event images stored on the API server
## which is api.primarydomain.org in these examples
## Solves CORS problems to proxy via Netlify
## cf https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://api.primarydomain.org/api/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/eventimages/*"
  to = "https://api.primarydomain.org/eventimages/:splat"
  status = 200

## have a www path you want to serve via some path on the backend?  here's how:

[[redirects]]
  from = "/my/specialpath"
  to = "https://api.primarydomain.org/api/special-back-end-path"
  status = 200
  force = true

## the official "all events" feed.  
## you'll probably want this somewhere on your ite!
[[redirects]]
  from = "/allevents"
  to = "https://api.primarydomain.org/api/shift-calendar.php"
  status = 200
  force = true

## remove trailing slashes via some magic.  
## fool can't really believe this works;  it is likely fragile!
## helps with prerendering: https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/post-processing/prerendering/

[[redirects]]
  from = "/addevent/*"
  to = "/addevent"
  status = 200
[[redirects]]
  from = "/calendar/*"
  to = "/calendar/event"
  status = 200

## have a path you want to simplify vs its real location, all front-end?
## note that this tells the client about the new location so the redirect
## will be automatic & will be client side in the future!
## here's how: 

[[redirects]]
  from = "/pedalpalooza"
  to = "/pages/pedalpalooza"
  status = 301
