# these map all urls under a starting path to a single page.
# ex. all urls starting with /calendar/ to the singular calendar page.
#
# currently, those singular pages are generated by hugo or vite.
# ie. `/calendar/event-ID` is handled by `content/calendar/event.md`
# and `/addevent/edit-ID-PASSWORD` by `content/addevent.md`
#
# note: this only works so long as there is no *actual* page stored at the full url.
