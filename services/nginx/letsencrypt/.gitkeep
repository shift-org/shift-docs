# tldr: this directory makes nginx happy during development.
#
# the nginx container expects the environment variable LETSENCRYPT_WEBROOT 
# to tell it a location on the host to map its /tmp/letscrypt directory 
# on production certbot.sh **requires** that the host directory also be called /tmp/letscrypt 
# but not all development machines have such a location (ie. windows)
